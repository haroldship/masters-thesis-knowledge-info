Relative MISE is the mean integrated relative squared error, where the relative squared error is computed in the following manner:
\[ \mbox{RSE}(x) = \left(\frac{\hat{f}(x)-f(x)}{f(x)}\right)^2 .\]
More generally, the relative error at a point \(x\) is computed as
\[ \mbox{RE}(x) =  \frac{\hat{f}(x)-f(x)}{f(x)} .\]
\autoref{fig:ise:unif_100_unif} shows the empirical distribution of the MISE and RMISE for the uniform intensity on uniform population.
The next row is the mean integrated absolute error (MIAE), which is followed by Relative MIAE which is computed analogously to Relative MISE.
This is followed by the Maximum error, which is the greatest absolute error over the study area.

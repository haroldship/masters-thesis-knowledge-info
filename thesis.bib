@article{fuentes2016consistent,
  Abstract = {Non-parametric estimation and bootstrap techniques play an important role in many areas of Statistics. In the point process context, kernel intensity estimation has been limited to exploratory analysis because of its inconsistency, and some consistent alternatives have been proposed. Furthermore, most authors have considered kernel intensity estimators with scalar bandwidths, which can be very restrictive. This work focuses on a consistent kernel intensity estimator with unconstrained bandwidth matrix. We propose a smooth bootstrap for inhomogeneous spatial point processes. The consistency of the bootstrap mean integrated squared error (MISE) as an estimator of the MISE of the consistent kernel intensity estimator proves the validity of the resampling procedure. Finally, we propose a plug-in bandwidth selection procedure based on the bootstrap MISE and compare its performance with several methods currently used through both as a simulation study and an application to the spatial patte},

  abstract = {
    Multiple independent streams of random numbers are often required in simulation studies, for instance, to facilitate synchronization for variance-reduction purposes, and for making independent replications. A portable set of software utilities is described for uniform random-number generation. It provides for multiple generators (streams) running simultaneously, and each generator (stream) has its sequence of numbers partitioned into many long disjoint contiguous substreams. The basic underlying generator for this implementation is a combined multiple-recursive generator with period length of approximately 2191, proposed by L'Ecuyer (1999a). A C++ interface is described here. Portable implementations are available in C, C++, and Java as supplemental material at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.50.6.1073.358

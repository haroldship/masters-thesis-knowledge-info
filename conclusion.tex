%% How good is Silverman?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We compared the performance of the \gls{dkd} under three different bandwidth schemes:
the \gls{oracle}, \gls{silverman}, and \gls{cv}.
In general, the \gls{oracle} performed best, followed by \gls{cv}, then \gls{silverman}.
However, there were a few cases where \gls{silverman} slightly outperformed \gls{cv}.
When we looked at a uniform risk function on a uniformly distributed population (\cref{sec:app:results_unif_unif}), \gls{silverman} was at least as good as \gls{cv} for every \gls{factor}.
The ratio of the \gls{mise} of \gls{silverman} to that of \gls{cv} for these experiments ranged from 0.94 to 1.0.

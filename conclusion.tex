%% How good is Silverman?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We compared the performance of the \acrlong{dkd} in a variety of test scenarios
under two different bandwidth selection schemes:
\gls{silverman} Rule of Thumb and \acrlong{cv}.
We did this using several measures of accuracy,
each of which reflects a real-world concern related to epidemiological studies.
The global measures \gls{mise} and \gls{miae} showed no significant performance difference
for the \gls{dkd} using both schemes,
leading us to consider preference for the \gls{silverman} method due to its greater ease of computation.
Furthermore,
the chosen bandwidths and the \gls{mise} in its absolute,
relative and normalized forms performed in line with the theory of
\Cref{sec:method:accuracy,sec:theory:bandwidthselection}.
However,
for finding the mode,
or the peak of the risk function,
the \gls{cv} bandwidths were superior in finding the location of the peak
while maintaining similar performance for the magnitude.

When we examine the behavior under different population distributions,
we can conclude that the \gls{dkd} is sensitive to large variations in population density.

In general, the \gls{oracle} performed best, followed by \gls{cv}, then \gls{silverman}.
On average, the \gls{mise} of \gls{silverman} was between 0\% and 200\% of the \gls{mise} of \gls{cv}.
However, there were a few cases where \gls{silverman} slightly outperformed \gls{cv}.
When we looked at a uniform risk function on a uniformly distributed population (\Cref{sec:app:results_unif_unif}), \gls{silverman} was at least as good as \gls{cv} for every \gls{factor}.
The ratio of the \gls{mise} of \gls{silverman} to that of \gls{cv} for these experiments ranged from 0.94 to 1.0.
For some values of \gls{mu} (200, 500 but not 50, 100, or 1000) the \gls{miae} and \gls{supremum error} were better than \gls{cv} as well.

We saw this phenomenon in a few other cases as well.
When there were two peaks, but they were close together, \gls{cv} was outperformed by \gls{silverman}.
In particular, when the distance between the peaks was 1.0 and 2.0, but not for larger distances of 3.0 and 4.0.
Also when there are peaks in both the population and the risk function, sometimes the \gls{cv} does not perform as well as \gls{silverman}.

Some other cases where this occurs include \Cref{tab:mean_error_rates:unif_100_0.7_1h,tab:mean_error_rates:unif5k_50_1.0_1h,tab:mean_error_rates:p0.7_100_1.0_1h}.

\section{Gradient descent for cross-validation}

We attempted to speed up the cross-validation bandwidth selection by using gradient descent.
We found the gradient descent algorithm often resulted in severe oversmoothing,
as the cross-validation error would decrease slowly as the bandwidth increased.
This required a lot of manual tuning of the learning rate parameter, and so required re-running the experiment several times.
We added \textit{momentum} to our gradient descent implementation but it did not help in every case, and so we changed our strategy to the one described in \autoref{ch:method}.

\end{table}

In this section, we look at incident risk function that have their peak at a different location from the peak in the population distribution.
We expect that as this distance grows, the relatively small population at the peak of the incident risk will make it difficult to obtain any information through observing incidents and estimating with the \gls{dkd}.
The results of the experiments described in this section are summarized in \Cref{tab:mean_error_rates:p1.4_100_1_1h_1s,tab:mean_error_rates:p1.4_100_1_1h_2s,tab:mean_error_rates:p1.4_100_1_1h_3s,tab:mean_error_rates:p1.4_100_1_1h_4s}.

\Cref{fig:ise:p1.4_100_Gap_risk} shows the different measures of \gls{mise} accuracy.
We can see from \Cref{fig:ise:p1.4_100_Gap_risk:nmise_log_log} that there is a linear relationship in the log-log graph,
indicating polynomial increase with positive coefficient of \gls{mise} when the distance between the incident and population peaks increases.
We see in \Cref{tab:results:nmise_convergence_by_pop_incident_gap} that the exponent is just over 1,
indicating just worse than linear.
